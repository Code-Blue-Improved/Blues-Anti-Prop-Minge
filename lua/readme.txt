Hello and thank you for purchasing this addon! So below is a list of stuff you should read.

If you don't want to read below or prefer to learn visually then watch this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZjHdXWW-NA

1. What is this addon?
This is an addon designed to prevent players from being able to interfere with other players experiences by using prop abuse using buildzones.

2. What are buildzones?
Build zones are areas that you define on the map that the player is authorised to build in. These zones can be authorised and de-authorised based on the players status in game. For example buy purchases a door you could then be authorised to build in a buildzone that belongs to that door.

3. How does it prevent abuse?
Well, what the addon does is create build zones which players are allowed to build in. They are not allowed to build outside of these so as a result cannot prop block other players, or prop kill people outside of there base etc.

4. How do I set it up?
Just spawn in the weapon BAM Control (in the q menu). Once you are holding it press R (or +reload) to open up the menu and from there you can create or remove properties. Each propery has a list of zones, doors, jobs that can all be added or removed as you want. Adding doors means who ever owns the door can build in all the zones in that property. You can have multiple doors and zones for a single property. Lasty you can add a job to the property for people like hobos, this will automaticly give that job the right to build in the zone without needing to purchase any door in the property (if any at all).

5. What can I do to define who can build in a buildzone?
Well, to define if people can build there or not you can use two methods. The first being doors, you can add doors to a property and by doing so which ever group/job/player owns that door will then automaticly have rights to build there, if they sell the door or change jobs they will automaticly be de-authorised an any props inside the zone will be removed.

6. What if I have more questions?
If you have more questions then please open a support ticket and be patient, I am very busy alot of the time and I do try my best to answer most support tickets in a reasonable time!
